## What can I do
- Using python

I can do almost anything with Python 3.x. I'm generally familiar with the basic grammar, and I've used many libraries that use Python.

- Using C/C++

I am familiar with the grammar of C/C++. Based on C99 and C++17, I've covered almost all of the features in that language specification.   
But now I don't like C/C++ very much. Because problems with build systems and package management. And because of old ideas.

- Reading English documents

Again, I am not good at reading English documents.   
I can interpret things like simple official documents, GitHub's repository descriptions, but I can't read them well in difficult texts or thesis.

- Writing English

Just simple sentence, like this.

- Using Docker

I only use docker as an automated server drive.

- Using Terminal Environment

I personally think I like the terminal environment. Of course, there are many restrictions, but I like to use with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

- Using Linux

I like the Linux environment, especially Archilinux. We usually use Xorg + KDE for Archilinux.   
Of course, I also like the normal Windows environment.

- Using git

I know the basic concepts, but honestly, I rarely used git in the CLI environment.

- Looking around interesting projects

I like to look around interesting projects. Navigation is often done using GitHub, Google Search, and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Geek News](https://news.hada.io/) in Korean.
